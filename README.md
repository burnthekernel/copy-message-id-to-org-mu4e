# Copy Message ID as an org mode link to mu4e 

This is an extension that adds a button to the message header toolbar to
copy the message ID to the clipboard so that it can be pasted into a org
buffer as a link to a mu4e message in Emacs. 

## Not in Mozilla Thunderbird add-ons platform
This is a trivial plugin that modifies https://github.com/garoose/copy-message-id.
At the moment, I have no intention to add it to Mozilla Thunderbird's add-ons 
platform.

## Installation
- Download copy-message-id-to-org-mu4e.xpi from Releases.
- In Thunderbird, go to the `Add-ons Manager`.
- Click `Install Add-on From File...` and select the `copy-message-id-to-org-mu4e.xpi`.
